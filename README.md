=============

This is a joke web application that I created for my friend. At the /translator page, the user can type in text. The text is then parsed, and every word is replaced with a random synonym if possible.

Initially, the application just consisted of the translation page. I added a user dashboard page that allows you to see some stats on previous translations. I did this to demonstrate use of Django's models.

There is currently no way to register or logout, and there is only one user. Username/Password = test/test

To run, start the standard Django development server and go to localhost:8000/translator
